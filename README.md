# Diffusion-Modeling

For my generative AI class, we were given an extra credit assignment that had us apply what we had learned up until that point (purely theoretical) to actual code, generating images based off of the MNIST dataset.

With this assignment, a template was provided for us that guided our coding ventures. The homework file in this repository contains that template, along with the code I used to fill out and build the diffusion model. 

While not perfect, I find this to be an exciting exercise into contemporary utilizations of AI and machine learning techniques, and look forward to finding new projects to expand the skills I learned here!
